### 🙋🏻‍♂️ About me
Currently, I am a data engineer for a credit union, and also a business intelligence analyst for 2 eCommerce businesses that I co-founded with my wife. Before this, I was part of a research team funded by the National Science Foundation in collaboration with NYU and Rutgers where I conducted sentiment analysis on MTA customers and statistical analysis on public transit performance of NYC metropolitan transit agencies. Prior to studying computer science, I was studying Civil Engineering at the City College of New York where I gained a lot of experience with data analysis tools, such as R, to explore and solve civil engineering problems involving fluid dynamics, hazard mitigation, and mechanics of deformable bodies.
